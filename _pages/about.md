# About Me
My name is Min-Jae Hwang. 
I am a research scientist at [Naver Corporation](https://www.navercorp.com/en).
I received my Ph.D. degree in department of Electrical and Electronics at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp).
During my Ph.D. course, I was fortunate to have research experiences as an intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Naver Corporation](https://www.navercorp.com/en).

My research interests include speech synthesis.
Specifically, my research history focuses on improving performance of neural waveform generation system, which can be also extended to other speech applications such as voice conversion, singing voice synthesis, or speech-to-speech translation.

I'm open to learn new knowledge and enjoy applying them to solve our society's real-world problems.
If you are interested in me, feel free to [contact me]({{ base_path }}/contacts.html).
