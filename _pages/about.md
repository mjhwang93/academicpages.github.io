My name is Min-Jae Hwang. 
I am a research scientist at [Naver Corporation](https://www.navercorp.com/en).
I received my Ph.D. degree at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp) in department of Electrical and Electronics.
During my Ph.D. course, I had an internship experiences as a researcher at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Naver Corporation](https://www.navercorp.com/en).

My research interests include speech synthesis.
Specifically, my research history mainly focuses on improving neural vocoding system for high-quality speech synthesis system, which has a potential to be extended to other speech applications such as voice conversion, singing voice synthesis, or speech-to-speech translation techniques.

I'm happy to learn new knowledge and enjoy applying them to solve our society's real-world problems.
If you are interested to me, feel free to contact me!
