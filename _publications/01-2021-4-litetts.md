In this paper, we propose a lightweight end-to-end text-tospeech model that can generate high-quality speech at breakneck speed. In our proposed model, a feature prediction module and a waveform generation module are combined within a single framework. The feature prediction module, which consists of two independent sub-modules, estimates latent space embeddings for input text and prosodic information, and the waveform generation module generates speech waveforms by conditioning on the estimated latent space embeddings. Unlike conventional approaches that estimate prosodic information using a pre-trained model, our model jointly trains the prosodic embedding network with the speech waveform generation task using an effective domain transfer technique. Experimental results show that our proposed model can generate samples 7 times faster than real-time, and about 1.6 times faster than FastSpeech 2, as we use only 13.4 million parameters. We confirm that the generated speech quality is still of a high standard as evaluated by mean opinion scores.
